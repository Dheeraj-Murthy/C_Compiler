# 💎 Bling Compiler Project (for ARM64 architecture) 🍏

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the **Bling Compiler** — a powerful toolchain designed to **translate Bling source code into optimized Apple Silicon (ARM64) assembly**. This compiler is thoughtfully architected and built from the ground up, encompassing three key phases: **lexical analysis**, **parsing**, and **code generation**.

The Bling language is minimalist yet expressive, supporting core constructs for computation. Here's a snippet that generates a Fibonacci-like sequence:

```bling
int x = 0;
int y = 1;
int z = 0;
int i = 1;

while(i neq 100){
  x = y;
  y = z;
  z = y + x;
  i = i + 1;
}

exit(x);
```

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Lexical Analyzer (Lexer):**  
  Converts `.bling` source files into a stream of **tokens** — recognizing **keywords**, **identifiers**, **operators**, **separators**, and **literals**.

- 🌲 **Parser:**  
  Builds an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** from the token stream, capturing the structural and syntactic essence of the code.

- ⚙️ **Code Generator (in progress):**  
  Traverses the AST to produce **ARM64 assembly instructions**, specifically optimized for **Apple Silicon**.

## 🛠 Getting Started

A `Makefile` is included to simplify building and running the compiler.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- 🧰 A C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`)
- 📦 `make` utility

### 🧱 Building the Compiler

```bash
make comp
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Compiler

To compile a Bling source file:

```bash
make run FILE=<your_file.bling>
```

> If no `FILE` is specified, it defaults to `test.bling`.

### 🧹 Cleaning Up

```bash
make clean
```

Removes all build artifacts and binaries.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 🧬 **Full ARM64 Code Generation:**  
  Finalize and polish the code generator for complete ARM64 coverage.

- 🧵 **Richer Language Support:**  
  Add **strings**, **floats**, and other primitive types.

- 🧠 **Advanced Control Flow:**  
  Support for `if`, `else`, nested loops, and **user-defined functions**.

- 🛡 **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Improve diagnostic messages and recovery mechanisms.

- 🧪 **Automated Testing Suite:**  
  Ensure correctness and performance of all components — **especially ARM64 output**.

# Bling Compiler Project

## Overview

This repository hosts the source code for the **Bling Compiler**, a sophisticated tool engineered to translate source code written in the proprietary **Bling programming language** into low-level assembly code. The compiler's architecture is meticulously designed, encompassing three critical phases: **lexical analysis**, **parsing**, and **code generation**.

The Bling language, though concise, demonstrates fundamental programming constructs. For instance, consider the following Bling code snippet, which computes a sequence reminiscent of the Fibonacci series:

```bling
int x = 0;
int y = 1;
int z = 0;
int i = 1;

while(i neq 100){
  x = y;
  y = z;
  z = y + x;
  i = i + 1;
}

exit(x);
```

## Features

- **Lexical Analyzer (Lexer):** This module meticulously processes the input `.bling` source file, performing **tokenization**. It accurately identifies and categorizes all linguistic elements, including **keywords**, **identifiers**, **operators**, **separators**, and **integer literals**, transforming the raw text into a stream of meaningful tokens.

- **Parser:** Operating on the token stream generated by the lexer, the parser is responsible for constructing an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. This AST serves as a robust intermediate representation, precisely capturing the syntactic and hierarchical structure of the original Bling source code, thereby facilitating subsequent compilation phases.

- **Code Generator (Under Development):** This integral component is engineered to systematically traverse the meticulously constructed AST. Its primary function is to translate the high-level semantic representation within the AST into corresponding **assembly language instructions**, specifically optimized for the **Apple Silicon (ARM64) architecture**. Please note that this feature is currently undergoing active development and continuous refinement.

## Getting Started

To facilitate the compilation and execution of the Bling Compiler, a comprehensive `Makefile` has been provided to streamline the entire process.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following essential tools are installed on your system:

- A **C compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- The **`make` utility**

### Building the Compiler

Navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command to initiate the build process:

```bash
make comp
```

### Running the Compiler

To compile a Bling source file, utilize the `run` target. Specify your input file by setting the `FILE` variable:

```bash
make run FILE=<your_file.bling>
```

Should the `FILE` variable remain undefined, the compiler will default to processing `test.bling` for demonstration purposes.

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

To maintain a clean working directory and remove all generated build files and executable binaries, employ the `clean` target:

```bash
make clean
```

## Project Structure

The project's codebase is logically organized into distinct modules, enhancing modularity and maintainability:

- `main.c`: Serves as the compiler's primary entry point, orchestrating essential file I/O operations and sequentially invoking the lexical analysis and parsing phases.
- `lexer.h`, `lexer.c`: Contains the robust implementation of the lexical analyzer.
- `parser.h`, `parser.c`: Houses the implementation of the parser, responsible for AST construction.
- `codegenerator.h`, `codegenerator.c`: Encompasses the ongoing and active implementation of the code generation logic.
- `utils/`: A dedicated directory containing various reusable utility functions, including a custom hash map implementation optimized for efficiency.
- `assembly/`: Stores critical resources and scripts pertinent to assembly code generation and rigorous testing procedures.
- `Makefile`: The comprehensive build automation script for the entire project.
- `test.bling`: An illustrative example of a Bling source file, provided for testing and demonstration.

## Future Enhancements

The Bling Compiler project is committed to continuous improvement and expansion. Planned future enhancements include:

- **Full Code Generator Implementation:** Completing and rigorously optimizing the code generator to produce highly robust, efficient, and fully functional assembly code.
- **Expanded Language Features:** Integrating support for a wider array of data types, such as **strings** and **floating-point numbers**, to enhance the expressiveness of the Bling language.
- **Advanced Programming Constructs:** Incorporating sophisticated programming constructs, including user-defined **functions**, advanced **control flow statements** (e.g., `if`, nested `while` loops), and complex **data structures**.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Developing and integrating robust error handling and recovery mechanisms within the parser to provide more informative diagnostics and improve compiler resilience.
- **Thorough Test Suite:** Establishing a comprehensive and automated test suite to rigorously ensure the correctness, reliability, and performance of all compiler components.
